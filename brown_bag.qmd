I celebrate and acknowledge the Traditional Owners and custodians of the land and waters from where we join you today, the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation. I pay my respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging and embrace their continued connection to this place. I pay my respects to all other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who may be joining us today. It always was and always will be Aboriginal land.

::: notes
I joined R-Laides Melburne hen Covid happened. For amost two years, we could not have any in person event. I didn't get to meet the rest of the organisors for amost two years. But it didn't stop us developing our R skills. We continue to give women works in data science and statisticas opportunity to share their R knowledge with us. With zoom, we are able to have oversea attendees joining us and it really brought all the R-ladies around the world together.
